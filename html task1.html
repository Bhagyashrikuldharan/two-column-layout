                    <h2>Search Engine</h2>
                    <p> A search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web searches. They search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query.
                         The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). 
                         The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files.
                          <hr/>Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, 
                          search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler. Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a
                           web search engine is generally described as the deep web.
